select N, 
    case
        when (P is null) then "Root"
        when (N in (select distinct P from BST)) then "Inner"
        else "Leaf"
    end    
from BST order by N asc;


--HINTS
P = parent of N
N = Value of a node

If P in null i.e. no parent then the node is "Root" node.
If N in in a list of P then N is "Inner" node. Because N is a parent of some other node.
Else "Leaf" node.
