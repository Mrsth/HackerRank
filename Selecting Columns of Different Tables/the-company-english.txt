--Explanation
For a company c1 and its founder we have to find their:
- Total number of lead manager
- Total number of senior manager
- Total number of manager
- Total number of employee

i.e. Monika C1 Company has:
- 1 lead manager
- 2 senior manager
- 1 manager
- 2 employee

So the Company table is linked with every other table. Hence, for finding
total number of lead manager of any company, link company table with lead manager table.
For finding total number of senior manager any company, link company table with senior manager table and so on.
